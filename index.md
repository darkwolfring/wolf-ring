Whether you want to focus more on spell use or your weapon, either way your Magic stat needs to be very high. A +5 crescent weapon not only allows for an A scaling in magic, but also allows for an average MP recovery, which makes this choice probably more relevant than a +5 moon weapon, but this depends on whether you also have invested in Strength and Dexterity.

If you want to emphasize spell use and only use your weapon as a last resort or for Backstab / Parry, the Madness Catalyst has a scaling of A in Magic, and grants a 50% boost in MP, making it a must-have for any aspiring mage. Coupled with the Monk's Head Bandages and the Kriss Sword, both of which increase magic damage by 30%, your spells will hurt like hell.

For the rest of the armor, the Cuirass gives good defenses but only the monk's cap is really important. For the rest, you can put whatever you want as long as you don't do a Fat Roll.

The [wolf ring](https://americanwolves.com/collections/wolf-ring) of magical acuity allows you to do even more damage with your spells while the ring of eternal warrior gives you a non-negligible recovery boost in stamina to retreat or roll in emergency.

Finally, for spells, Inflammation is not necessarily necessary since you have your sword to defend yourself in close combat but some prefer to use it to take advantage of Magic boosts. Soul Ray, Seek Arrow and Fireball are essential for ranged attacks.

While the Souls series from FromSoftware studio is now known to most gamers, there are many who have not yet dared to take the step of trying one of the titles, often because of the reputation of very difficult games that they have. If you've finally decided to take the plunge and give Demon's Souls Remake a try, here are some basic tips that may help make your adventure more peaceful.

**Always use souls to charge your wolf ring**

One of the most famous mechanics of Souls is that of souls. Specifically, souls serve as both currency and experience points that you can spend to level up. The problem is that, unlike most games, you can lose these souls. Indeed, when you die, your soul counter will go back to 0. However, you have one last chance to get your souls back by returning to the place where you died and touching your bloodstain to the ground. However, if you die again without being able to recover your souls, they will be lost permanently.

To avoid this, the best thing to do is to avoid wandering around the worlds (especially if it's an area you don't know) with your pockets full of souls. Even if you have a second chance to get them back, a stupid death can happen quickly and losing tens of thousands of souls is never really pleasant, especially at the beginning when the possibilities of Farm are very limited.

In other words, as soon as you can, use them, whether it's to level up, improve or repair your equipment, buy items... This is especially true after every boss fight: going back to the Nexus to level up should be the first thing you do. To rush headlong into the exploration of a new area still in possession of your just earned souls is to do everything possible to lose them.

**PLAYING OFFLINE**

This is especially true if you want to make the 100% and/or the platinum of the game. This is because when you play online, it results in so much change in the Worlds Trend. Each time you log in, the Trend of each world will be based on the average of the Trend of all players online instead of the Trend level of your last login.

When playing online, you lose control over the Trend of the worlds. This is especially problematic when there are very limited opportunities to have a pure white Trend for each world. As a reminder, the Tendency of a world becomes white every time you defeat a non-optional boss of that world. It will therefore become impossible to get a pure white Tendency for the world in question from the moment you blacken the Tendency, either by dying in human form or by playing online. This will prevent you from accessing certain equipment, weapons, quests, and Pure White Tendency player benefits.

However, if you find that playing offline deprives you of a part of the game and you still want to discover the benefits of the multiplayer part of the game like PvP, cooperation... You can always consider your first game as a discovery game and not be afraid to miss too much. Since 100% requires at least two extra NG+ anyway because of some miracles and spells, it's not too bad to miss some events during your first game. However, it will be essential to play offline for the following games to have a total mastery of the Tendencies.

**PLAYING IN SOUL FORM**

The soul form corresponds to the form that has a spectral aspect. This form is not only aesthetic since it has direct consequences on the course of the game. The main consequence is to decrease your life bar by 50%. The only way to become human again is to use an ephemeral eye stone or to beat a non-optional boss.

Because of the life bar penalty, new players will tend to play with a human form believing that it will make the game easier. However, this is probably the best way to make the game more difficult. Indeed, every time you die in human form in a world, it will darken the Trend of the world in question. In fact, the more you die in human form in a world, the more complicated it will become until you reach the pure black Tendency. And to be blunt, the levels in Pure Black Tendency become much harder, especially if you are still at the beginning of your game.

On the other hand, dying in soul form has no effect on the Tendency of the worlds so by playing permanently in soul form you can only whiten the Tendencies and make the game easier for yourself. Don't forget that every time you defeat a boss, you become human again so in order to avoid darkening the Tendency of a world, it is advisable to commit suicide in the Nexus in order to regain the soul form. Although the Nexus has a Tendency, it does not matter.

**DON'T USE BOSS SOULS RANDOMLY**

After each boss victory, you will get a very special soul that is unique to each boss. Like all souls, they can be used to gain more or less souls to level up or get "money". However, using boss souls for this purpose would be a real waste.
